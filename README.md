### About me
I am a belgiun web dev with big interests in game dev. Actually I work in a legal office and dev their platform with an another dev. 

You can find my pro GitHub account [here](https://www.github.com/LucasGL-png) 

Currently I work on my free time on a 2D STR game. I hope it will be available at the end 2026.

I founded a litle game dev studio this year where I hope to work with some others devs and artists on some funny projects where each will be equal.
Here you can visit the studio's web site : [FiveDogsProduction](https://www.fivedogsproduction.be)

#### My favorites technologies :
##### For game dev
  - Godot engine: the gdscript one and C++ to build modules.
  - Unreal Engine: only the C++ part, I am not really a big fan of the blueprint.

##### For web dev:
  - React : Off course
  - Asp.NEt
  - AdonisJS

If you have any question about an issue on Godot I'll be happy to disccuss about it with you
